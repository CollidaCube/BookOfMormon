# 1 Nephi / Chapter 1
1\. I, Nephi, was born into a righteous family. I
was taught the gospel and developed my testimony.
I have seen the blessings of the Lord throughout
my trials and intend to write about these miracles
which I have seen.<br>

2\. I will make these writings based on what I've
learned of the Jewish understanding. These will be
written in Egyptian.

3\. I know everything I write here is true, with an
unshakable certainty, because I write these words
myself. All these words I write are of my own
knowledge.

4\.
